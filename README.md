- **Create tables in PostgreSQL:**
  - Define the schema and create the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database to store the imported data.

- **Import CSV file into PostgreSQL:**
  - Use SQL commands or PostgreSQL tools to import the CSV file into the created tables in the PostgreSQL database.

### 2. Data Cleaning, Processing & DAX

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Remove any duplicates, handle missing values, and correct inconsistencies in the data.
  - Ensure data integrity and readiness for analysis.

- **Data Processing:**
  - Transform the cleaned data into a suitable format for analysis.
  - Aggregate and calculate necessary metrics.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):**
  - Use DAX formulas in Power BI to create calculated columns and measures.
  - Implement advanced calculations to derive meaningful insights.

### 3. Dashboard & Insights
